Shirley Temple,Come And Get Your Happiness,Lyrics/Music Yellen/Pokrass Why are grown up peoples faces Wrinkled like a lot of prunes Money money that's what chases them Around like crazy loon's I think they make a big mistake Wealth and happiness that counts Are free to all in large amounts  There's millions worth of golden sunbeams That everybody can possess All Gods children got success Come and get your happiness There's billions worth of silver moonbeams Enough for everyone I guess What's a million more or less Come and get your happiness Among the wildwood of your happy childhood Where you were Jill's and Jack In raggy britches there's a lot of riches On which you don't pay any income tax So get under their blue heaven Away from trouble and distress Just find Mother Nature's address And come and get your happiness,hip hop,Little Miss Shirley Temple,joy,20,66,68,100,1,7,30,64,-11.91db,14,0

Emperor,With Strength I Burn,"Deep Green Dark Chaos Blinded I run down these paths By heart I know them They lead to the soaring cliffs Stout they stand above the water's edge Lifeless  And this is my foundation Cold stone Formed only by winds and time How invulnerable Lifeless  Ahh... I have longed to be at one with this Yet, the waters call my name  For once I wish to see The entity behind the voice The face of this seduction The beauty of my pain Am I blessed or am I cursed by thy presence? What is my crime? What is my deed? Is this life my redemption? Shall I repent or proceed?  I hate my flesh Its dimension poisoned my soul with doubt It made me question the essence of... The 'I'  Slaves are those of this world Given freedom to lay the chains upon The Master The wolf is no longer free Release the chains and come for me  Suddenly, his mournful cries were stunned Out of the cold mist came three enthralling ships Sails torn by many a storm, and the bows adorned by the Most fierce gargoyles he'd ever laid eyes upon. Yet, the Crew they bore... Three times twelve in numbers. They Stood motionless, wrapped in grey, worn gowns And from behind their shadowed faces the seductive chanting Bidding him on board. without hesitation, he accepted And away they sailed... Upon these seas Wherein I drowned so many times I scatter the ashes of destiny Still my flame is in hunger  With fire in my heart Shall I greet the shores ahead Though, I know not what will burn...  Desire...  Ahh... In the distance I hear the waves wash over solid ground And in this moment I am struck blind  Grant me sight so I can see That which lies ahead of me Cursed be my mortal eyes For dying in this realm of death  Hear my call...  I return to the soaring cliffs They truly shine of strength Even though I nothing learned With strength I burn...","progressive metal,metal,black metal",Anthems To The Welkin At Dusk,sadness,94,9,4,0,93,10,38,166,-4db,30,33

Let your grace rain down on me. Let you alone be enough for me. I’m praying for a place where You take my pain away. I can’t think clearly. Lord, did you hear me because my head is in the clouds?

Ashok,Under The Thumb,"I used to listen to him sitting on my shoulder But he's losing my affection, I've fallen for another He made me do some bad things but you make me do the worst He's been around for centuries, but you were still the first He may have fire and brimstone, all the power in the world But I'm not trying to impress him now that I'm your girl He says he wants me back and I don't know what to do 'Cos I don't need the devil now that I've got you  He has so many tricks but next to you he looks the fool And it's no longer for him that I keep on breaking rules When he told me to take one, you tell me to take four When he said smash the window, you say: break down the door! He sent me pearls and roses, a diamond necklace too But I don't need the devil now that I got you  We don't need the devil now, we've got each other We don't need the storm when we're making our own thunder Now we don't need The Reaper, we're already six feet under!

It was something useful Fuck the games! Tell me Was it something beautiful The dutiful brotherly aspect that was torn Away out the funeral? I fell halved I can't explain it At first I laughed so hard It locked the pain in As rain swept In tandem with the concept of prophetic fallacy I tried to put into context the extent of the tragedy But Nothing was happening I guess I was panicking To get with the plan again Nothing was rubbing in I had to stop fumbling Because there's nothing but trouble in Rummaging for the truth When there's nothing more pummelling that the proof That something as powerful as the 'two' Could be so easily damaged or even reduced! So where's this leave you now? You're not alone But you're not the same And that's the difference in a daily way Anyway Past the trivia lies the main meal That even a myriad of counterpoints couldn't help reveal; I think in some weird way This could work out I'm smiling up, right? And he's smiling back down... But since I'm gravity bound I think Fuck it! I'm going to move on around And not forget So fucking forget about it! It's a different purpose, not a different outfit Look at me mouth in and then pronounce it He's my brother So fucking forget about it!

Z-Flo,The White People Song,"[Intro] This song is dedicated to a certain kind of people, which just so happens to be— my other favorite kind of people You know the ones that like to you know; hurt themselves bro? Skateboard ollie bro, kickflip, split their lip bro?... Kick me in the nuts, bro? You get what I’m saying, right?  [Chorus] White people, I get bullied in school I can’t wait til I’m a cop so I can bully you, White People Hey White people, no no, we can’t dance And I don’t whoop my kids or spank their hands White people (Bad Michael, go to your room!)  [Verse 1] If you poke me on my arm, I bruise easily So I only quarterback in the Football League I like to watch porn, I can fap for days And my favorite potato chips are Lays (because they’re white) I take weird drugs like ecstasy Mushrooms, Crystal Meth, and LSD We put it in a pipe, or a homemade bong And watch out for the priest, he will rape your son And most of us will die trying out for Fear Factor I guess that’s why they say I’m just a country-loving, deer-hunting, rabbit-eating, redneck, inbreeding, beer-drinking, small penis…. did I mention we drive a tractor? We're red when we’re mad, when we’re sick, we’re green Only race in the world that eats sardines White girls, flat butts, and I know that’s mean But if you try to eat the booty, taste like saltines (Back far away from that anus) A white woman came to me to bash my song Until she realized I was black and then she…. zipped her purse? [Chorus] White people, I get bullied in school I can’t wait til I’m a cop so I can bully you White People White people, no no, we can’t dance And I don’t whoop my kids or spank their hands White people (See this is probably why all those white kids shoot up schools)  [Verse 2] Hold up, hold up; we can’t have a white song without any country music in it We all like country music, nawh-nah- no-hum-nawh You never understand what I’m saying, nawh-nah-nawh-nah nah nahnah nannah humh NAWR But if you ever come to Texas…. come chill with me on my porch ‘Cause we all got shotguns, and we all commute by horse We have farms, we like to mosh, We like Family GUYYY and we like Tosh!!! I guess my point here is… if you’re white, we automatically like you  [Chorus] White people, I get bullied in school I can’t wait til I’m a cop so I can bully you, White People Hey White people, Can’t jump that high So if you tryna lose the cops, find a fence nearby White people  White People Since 76, being jerks making other races look like sh** White People (Seriously, all of us are racist) White People I know you can’t stand me But we all still evolved from a chimpanzee White People [Outro] Alright, this is probably also the most racist song I’ve ever written, but if you laughed, you’re racist too…. So I don’t feel bad…. besides…. it’s not racist if I'm human. Get it? The human race?

The artist was tender  But suffered from guilt  Making him sorry  The following day  And he made me feel guilty  The very same way  In his bed on the following day  The other would take me  And feel no remorse  He'd wake with a smile  In the bed where we lay  And he made me smile In the very same way  In his bed on the following day  The blow to my soul  By fear and taboos  Cut deeper far  Than a bodily bruise  And the one who was gentle  Hurt me much more  Than the one who was rough  And made love on the floor,hip hop,Mythical Kings And Iguanas,sadness,15,35,28,98,9,4,10,103,-17.57db,14,287

Tracy Chapman,Telling Stories,There is fiction in the space between The lines on your page of memories Write it down but it doesn't mean You're not just telling stories  There is fiction in the space between You and reality You will do and say anything To make your everyday life seem less mundane There is fiction in the space between You and me  There's a science fiction in the space between You and me A fabrication of a grand scheme Where I am the scary monster I eat the city and as I leave the scene In my spaceship I am laughing In your remembrance of your bad dream There's no one but you standing Leave the pity and the blame For the ones who do not speak You write the words to get respect and compassion And for posterity You write the words and make believe There is truth in the space between  There is fiction in the space between You and everybody Give us all what we need Give us one more sad sordid story But in the fiction of the space between Sometimes a lie is the best thing Sometimes a lie is the best thing Ohh the best thing Is the best thing Ohh the best thing Is the best thing,"rock,pop,folk",Telling Stories,sadness,64,66,28,7,0,3,11,123,-10db,50,289

Go ahead And ask a question and see where the answer gets you Try bein’ passive aggressive or try smashin’ heads in And see which tactic brings your plans to fruition And if you have an explanation in mind, then you’re Wastin’ your time, ‘cause the best watchmaker is blind It takes a certain base kind of To explain away nature with “intelligent  But the truth shall set you free From those useless superstitious, beliefs In a , and that Edenic myth ‘Cause their family tree is showin’ some genetic drift Take it from this bald-headed non-celibate monk With the lyrical equivalent of an elephant’s trunk It’s time to elevate your mind-state And celebrate your kinship with the primates The weak and the strong, who got it goin’ on? We lived in the dark for so long The weak and the strong, Darwin got it goin’ on Creationism is dead wrong “The view which most naturalists entertain ... namely that each species has been independently created, is erroneous.” Charles Darwin, Origin of Species  Okay, it’s time to reveal my identity I’m the manifestation of tens of millions Of centuries of sexual selection, best believe I’m the best of the best of the best of the best  Of generations of competitive pressure genetically But don’t get upset, ‘cause we’ve got the same pedigree You and I will find a common ancestor eventually If we rewind geological time regressively And I could say the same for this hibiscus tree And this lizard and this flea and this sesame seed And if you still disbelieve in what your senses perceive Then I could even use this rhyme as a remedy ‘Cause there’s so much variation in the styles in this industry And differential survival when the people listening Decide what they’re into and what really isn’t interesting  You could thrive like Timberlake on a Timberland beat Or go extinct like Vanilla Ice and N’Sync It’s survival of the fittest, but It changes from place to place and from winter to spring But the real question in this social-scientific simile Is heredity, whether we inherit our techniques From our predecessors, or invent them independently But then we’re talkin’ memes and that’s a different thing Richard Dawkins can I get a proper definition please?

I believe God made me in a day – Jesus saves!” Yeah, he’s great, but stop bein’ afraid To use the reason “he” gave you to let science solve Some giant problems and find some final results  I think it’s time for y’all to let your minds evolve And listen to a different kind of silent call The kind that comes from pine trees and not Pinesol I’m talkin’ about the mystical vision that Einstein saw Wondering at the infinite depth of divine thought And realizing that scripture can never define God ‘Cause if there is a personal God, then he’s been jerkin’ off So why would he bother designing an albatross Especially when natural selection does such an excellent job Just by balancing benefits and costs? I say banish God into the gaps If he can’t help us understand the simplest facts I want a relaxed God of infinite naps We’ll be all right without him, just give us a chance The weak and the strong, who got it goin’ on We lived in the dark for so long The weak and the strong, Darwin got it goin’ on Creationism is dead wrong",hip hop,The Rap Guide to Evolution,joy,75,67,69,46,0,31,11,105,-5.24db,0,467

SHADDW,A Story No One Told,"[Hook] Picture life etched in stone Life sketched in poems On sidewalks in dry chalk next to homes Picture all you’ve left alone And kept in reflections shown Your dome sketched in subjective tones Picture life on a sidewalk Frame it - so all view All you’ve ever felt Try to name it - its called you Picture it In the space between steps It’s the grace between breaths And the message in this make-believe text Picture …  [Verse 1] God exhaled The moon shivered in a blue river Stardust fell Through space released and gave its peace To a man in his place beneath Graciously as he laid asleep Draped in sheets With his honest wife In the gold days of his old age And on this nice August night His soul raised He saw this light - the calmest bright - Like Coldplay, it was all yellow And in its gold rays, he saw his plight As it showed him the youth that he’d forgot about Like how he block the spout on his house’s hose And not let the water out He thought it out and wondered How he’d remembered it all? How younger he’d enter the halls When summer surrendered the fall Then he wondered was his life through? In slumber under this bright moon? Like skies after thunder, the light grew And more from the limitless stash of images flashed And poured from the reservoir to mimic his past He saw himself with his wife growing old His children’s lives He filled with pride as the light showed his soul Then it’s brilliance died … [Verse 2] And it was dead black in his eyes A voice said that it was time But he was steadfast in his mind So he said back in reply “Please! Seeing my life like this It made me think I could state succinctly everything life is If you gave me ink And I could maybe print every speech and thought And release my plot on these streets I’ve walked With a piece of chalk To paint the sharpest image of a heart Cuz as much as art can mimic Nothing’s as real as a life told from start to finish” Suddenly the man awoke with a violent cry That strangely didn’t seem to disturb the silent sky His wife was still beside him under the blankets enclosed And when he looked up at the clock he saw the hands in it froze So the man just arose, put his hands to the roads And began to compose the most candid of prose…  [Verse 3] So he wrote every quote spoken And left every breath kept Sketched in the next step of concrete Then Death crept and lead him to his bed As the sun began to rise He titled his surprise “The Story of the Man that Died” Then his wife and the townsfolk awoke and were shocked First by his passing, but then by what he wrote with his chalk They got the roads blocked by a flock of postmen and cops He wrote from his lot to the edge of town close to the docks Where he used to watch the boats and often joked with his pops His folks had not long ago passed and now both with him walk People came from everywhere They read the story through for days It wasn’t nothing new or strange Still they were moved and amazed It wasn’t the places he’d been or the people he’d met It was the spaces between and the secrets he’d kept They wept joyfully, for the greatest story no one told Was just the story of an ordinary man growing old [Hook]",hip hop,All I Gotta Say,anger,91,73,36,1,84,10,6,150,-4.38db,24,478

Bloodhound Gang,A Lap Dance Is So Much Better When the Stripper Is Crying,"[Verse 1] I was lonelier than Kunta Kinte at a Merle Haggard concert that night I strolled on into Uncle Limpy's Hump Palace lookin' for love. It had been a while In fact, three hundred and sixty-five had come and went since that midnight run haulin' hog to Shakey Town on I-10. I had picked up this hitchhiker that was sweatin' gallons through a pair of Daisy-Duke cut-offs and one of those Fruit of the Loom tank-tops Well, that night I lost myself to ruby red lips, milky white skin and baby blue eyes. Name was Russell  [Chorus] Yes, a lap dance is so much better when the stripper is cryin' Yes, a lap dance is so much better when the stripper is cryin' Well, I find it's quite a thrill When she grinds me against her will Yes, a lap dance is so much better when the stripper is cryin'  [Verse 2] Well, faster than you can say ""shallow grave"", this pretty little thing come up to me and starts kneadin' my balls like hard-boiled eggs in a tube sock. Said her name was Bambi and I said, ""Well that's a coincidence darlin', 'cause I was just thinkin' about skinnin' you like a deer."" Well, she smiled, had about as much teeth as a Jack-O-Lantern, and I went on to tell her how I would wear her face like a mask as I do my little kooky dance. And then she told me to shush. I guess she could sense my desperation 'Course, it's hard to hide a hard-on when you're dressed like Minnie Pearl  [Chorus] Yes, a lap dance is so much better when the stripper is cryin' Yes, a lap dance is so much better when the stripper is cryin' Well, I find it's quite a thrill When she grinds me against her will Yes, a lap dance is so much better when the stripper is cryin' [Verse 3] So, Bambi's goin' on about how she can make all my fantasies come true. So I says, ""Even this one I have where Jesus Christ is jackhammering Mickey Mouse in the doo-doo hole with a lawn dart as Garth Brooks gives birth to something resembling a cheddar cheese log with almonds on Santa Claus's tummy-tum?"" Well, ten beers, twenty minutes and thirty dollars later, I'm parkin' the beef bus in tuna town if you know what I mean. Got to nail her back at her trailer. Heh. That rhymes I have to admit it was even more of a turn-on when I found out she was doin' me to buy baby formula  [Chorus] Yes, a lap dance is so much better when the stripper is cryin' Yes, a lap dance is so much better when the stripper is cryin' Well, I find it's quite a thrill When she grinds me against her will Yes, a lap dance is so much better when the stripper is cryin'  [Verse 4] Day or so had passed when I popped the clutch, gave the tranny a spin and slid on into the Stinky Pinky Gulp N' Guzzle Big Rig Snooze-A-Stop. There I was browsin' through the latest issue of Throb when I saw Bambi starin' at me from the back of a milk carton. Well, my heart just dropped So, I decided to do what any good Christian would: You can not imagine how difficult it is to hold a half gallon of moo juice and polish the one-eyed gopher when you're doin' seventy-five in an eighteen-wheeler. I never thought missing children could be so sexy Did I say that out loud?  [Chorus] Yes, a lap dance is so much better when the stripper is cryin' Yes, a lap dance is so much better when the stripper is cryin' Well, I find it's quite a thrill When she grinds me against her will Yes, a lap dance is so much better when the stripper is cryin'","alternative rock,rock,alternative",Hooray For Boobies,sadness,61,88,91,10,1,4,8,104,-8.79db,41,538

Adam, Adam, where are you?""

Her glee was indivisible From all emanations that the baby would make I had to become less hilarious for all of our sakes I made mistakes, I’ll admit it.
